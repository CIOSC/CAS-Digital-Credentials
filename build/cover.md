# Introduction 
The Technical Specification is intended to support a prototype conformity assessment program for digital credentials and digital trust services and is intended to be a method of test to provides repeatable and reproducible procedures with consistent outcomes for the assessment of the products being assess. 

This specification provides a small-scale set of conformity assessment criteria that are based on digital credential policy and regulatory objectives of Canadian governments. 

This specification supports conformity assessment needs that can 
* provide market structure and clarity for digital credentials and digital trust services. 
* enable interoperability and mutual support for digital credentials and digital trust services nationally and internationally.
* offer an avenue for product differentiation and competition between developers and providers.
* provide greater consumer confidence in digital credentials and digital trust services and products, thus potentially helping with adoption.
* provide a means for third-party assessment of the safety, efficacy, and ethical profile of digital credentials and digital trust services.* 
* provide Canadian governments with a standards-based tool for establishing regulations for digital credentials and digital trust services.
