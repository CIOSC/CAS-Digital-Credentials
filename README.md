## Overview of this Repository

This repository contains industsry and government expert contributions in support of the development of standards=based conformity assessment schemes for digital credentials, digital trust services and digital wallets.

## Strategic Context

This content and supporting tools are intended to contribute to the establishment of digital trust, enablement of national and international interoperability, and the mitigation of related risks.

This repo and associated deliverables are intended to support strategic outcomes of:

* Fostering standardization for the future of the digital credential ecosystem
* Establish a baseline of trust for products, processes and services.
* Enable interoperabilty across jurisdictins and economic sectors
* Mitigate risks ot vendor lock-in, ecosystem fragmentatina and platform capture

This repo is intended to provide the context of a prototype conformity assessment scheme for which the technical specification may be applied.

## Immediate Objectives

* To develop a publicly available Github repository, consisting of conformity assessment scheme elements that can be used to define conformity assessment criteria to support conformity assessment programs.
* Content is developed on a continuous basis by contributing technical experts. Draft publications are built on a periodic basis for peer review and publication.
* Draft working versions of the technical specifications are available as .docx and .pdf at: [Technical Specification - working versions](./build/build.md).
* Finalized versions of the technical specification will be published and made available in English and French [here](./publish/publish.md)
