# Standardization for Digital Credentials & Digital Trust Services

## Overview of this Repository

This repository is the open collaboration workspace for the development of conformity assessment tools and publicatons for digital credentials and the digital trust services in Canada. These tools are intended to establish trust, enable national and international interoperability, and mitigate risks of platform capture and industry fragmentation.

## Technical Specification Deliverables

Deliverables are being developed through a multi-phased approach with on-going opportunities for consultation and feedback from national and international stakeholders.

The **National Technical Specification (TS-115)** is being collaboratively developed by means of this repository. The initial version of the technical specification is being developed by a technical committee and draft working versions are are periodically built based on this repo. 

* Draft working versions of the technical specifications are available as .docx and .pdf at: [Technical Specification - working versions](./build/build.md).
* Finalized versions of the technical specification will be published and made available in English and French [here](./publish/publish.md)

## Project Detail Summary

* This project is being carried out under CIOSC Service Agreement No. 2022‐07 ‐ National Technical Specification for digital credentials and digital trust services. An excerpt of the [statement of work](./docs/statement-of-work.md) is available.
* The primary deliverable is the [Technical Specification](./scheme/scheme.md) which is being developed as a Github repository, consisting of  comformity assessment scheme elements that can be used to define a small-scale set of conformity assessment criteria to support a protototy conformity assessment program.
* The elements of the technical specification that are developed are part of this service agreement are organized within the context of a [Conformity Assessment Scheme Document](./scheme/scheme.md) intended to support a prototype conformity assessment program.

## Program Context

This repo and associated technical specification deliverables are intended to support program outcomes of:

* Fostering standardization for the future of the digital credential ecosystem
* Establish a baseline of trust for products, processes and services.
* Enable interoperabilty across jurisdictins and economic sectors
* Mitigate risks ot vendor lock-in, ecosystem fragmentatina and platform capture

This repo is intended to provide the context of a prototype conformity assessment scheme for which the technical specification may be applied.

This project is managed by the [Standards Council of Canada](https://www.scc.ca/) and has many opportunties for involvement of government bodies, standards development organizations, certification bodies, and developers of digital credentials and digital trust products and services.
