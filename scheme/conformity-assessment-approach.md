# Conformity Assessess Approach
The conformity assessment process uses a functional approach as set out in ISO/IEC 17000.

## Selectin and Determination

For each object of conformity of assessment, the following MUST be specified and carried out:

1. Description of an appropriate [use case](./use-cases.md) that situates the context where the object of conformity is being used.
2. Selection of the product, service and/or process that is being tested in relation to the [objects of conformity assessment](./objects-of-conformity-assessment.md) and specified requirements.
3. Selection of appropriate [standards and specifications](./standards-specifications.md) to which conformity will be assessed.
4. Determination of activities to obtain information regarding the fulfillment  of the specified requirements. For the purposes of this scheme, activities are the [methods of test](./methods-of-tests.md). Other means - **inspection**, **auditing**, **validation & verification** are outside of scope.
5. Determination of outputs that will be used as input into the review, decision and attestation stage.


# Review, decision and attestation

1. **Review:** The final stage of checking before taking the decision as to whether or not the object of conformity assessment e.g. product, service and system, has been reliably demonstrated to fulfil the specified requirements.
2. **Attestation:** The creation of a “statement of conformity”, which is a generic expression used to include all means of communicating that fulfilment of specified requirements has been demonstrated. It should be noted that a "statement of conformity" can include non fulfilment of specified requirements.

# Surveillance

As required.
