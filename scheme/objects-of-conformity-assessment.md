# Objects of Conformity Assessment
An **object of conformity assessment** is formal specification of a product, process, or service component (or components) that can be evaluated according to:
* set of specified (minimum) requirements
* subject to a defined method of test

The overall goal is to have consistent, repeatable tests that can be carried out by a third party and to give confidence to all interested parties that the product, process or service fulfils the specified requirements.



This scheme defines objects of conformity assessment categorized by the major headings below. Specific objects of conformity are listed with a links to the corresponding conformity assessment requirements.

Objects of conformity can be specified in conjuction with related product standards and guides to demonstrate that a product, process or service complies with specified criteria.

# Digital Credential Management System 
A digital credential management system consist of the following components that can be assessed for the purposes of conformity:

## Issuance
* Type

## Management

## Storage

## Presentation

* [JOSE](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/jose/charter/)

## Verification

# Digital Credentials
## Definition
**Digital Credentials** is a portable digital records about a subject (e.g., organization, individual, product) that can be held and shared through a user-controlled wallet. They are the digital representation of traditional physical certificates or information,

## Minimum Requirements

* Digital credentials issued by a system SHALL be tamper-evident. Include the testing/test method requirements for proving a digital credential is tamper-evident

* The authorship of digital credentials issued by a system shall be cryptographically verified.

## Methods of Test

* TBD


# Credential Data Models

 Credential data models are composed of three main components: credential metadata, credential attributes (claims) and cryptographic material which allows a holder to prove the authenticity of presented data to a verifier. 


# Encoding / Decoding Formats
A format is a means to structure and convey information. This may also include encoding and decoding. 

### Requirements

1. Formats MUST demonstrate conformity to one or serveral of the following specifications 

* [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html)
* [JWT](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7519)

### Methods of Test



# Digital Trust Services
Digital trust services may consist of the following components that can be assessed for the purposes of conformity:

## Issuing Services

## Verification Services

# Verifiable Data Registry
A role a system might perform by mediating the creation and verification of identifiers, keys, and other relevant data, such as verifiable credential schemas, revocation registries, issuer public keys, and so on, which might be required to use verifiable credentials. Some configurations might require correlatable identifiers for subjects. Example verifiable data registries include trusted databases, decentralized databases, government ID databases, and distributed ledgers. Often there is more than one type of verifiable data registry utilized in an ecosystem. [Source](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/)
