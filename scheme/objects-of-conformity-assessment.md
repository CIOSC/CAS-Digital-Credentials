# Objects of Conformity Assessment
An **object of conformity assessment** is formal specification of a product, process, or service component (or components) that can be evaluated according to:
* set of specified (minimum) requirements
* subject to a defined method of test

The overall goal is to have consistent, repeatable tests that can be carried out by a third party and to give confidence to all interested parties that the product, process or service fulfils the specified requirements.

This scheme defines objects of conformity assessment categorized by the major headings below. Specific objects of conformity are listed with a links to the corresponding conformity assessment requirements.

Objects of conformity are specified in connjuction with related product standards and guides to demonstrate that a product, process or service complies with specified criteria.

Where possible, objects of conformity are defined with reference to relevant **legislation**, **policy**, **regulation**, **standard** or **guidance** issued by a [competent authority](./scheme-definitions.md)

A role a system might perform by mediating the creation and verification of identifiers, keys, and other relevant data, such as verifiable credential schemas, revocation registries, issuer public keys, and so on, which might be required to use verifiable credentials. Some configurations might require correlatable identifiers for subjects. Example verifiable data registries include trusted databases, decentralized databases, government ID databases, and distributed ledgers. Often there is more than one type of verifiable data registry utilized in an ecosystem. [Source](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/)
