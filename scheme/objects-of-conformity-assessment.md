# Overview
The overall aim of the conformity assessment of products, processes or services is to give confidence to all interested parties that a product, process or service fulfills specified requirements. The value of a conformity assessment scheme is to contribute to the degree of confidence and trust that can established by an impartial and competent demonstration of fulfillment of specified requirements carried out by a third-party.

A conformity assessment scheme:
* provide consumers (users) of products with sufficient information to allow them to make informed decisions on products and services;
* assist the suppliers to achieve market acceptance. If the product has a recognizable mark on it consumers may be more willing to make the purchase;
* can play a role in regulated products (subject to technical regulations);
* assists vendors and customers in selecting the components for their own products and services;
* given confidence to solution providers and integrators confidence in the products they are using.

# Objects of Conformity Assessment
Categories of objects of conformity assessment are listed by the major headings below. Specific objects of conformitiy are listed with a links to the corresponding conformity assessment requirements.
* Product
* Process
* Service 

Objects of conformity can be specified in conjuction with related product standards and guides to demonstrate that a product, process or service complies with specified criteria.


# Digital Credential Management System 
A digital credential management system consist of the following components that can be assessed for the purposes of conformity:

## Issuance
* Type

## Management

## Storage

## Presentation

* [JOSE](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/jose/charter/)

## Verification

# Credential Data Models

 Credential data models are composed of three main components: credential metadata, credential attributes (claims) and cryptographic material which allows a holder to prove the authenticity of presented data to a verifier. 


# Encoding / Decoding Formats
A format is a means to structure and convey information. This may also include encoding and decoding. 

### Requirements

1. Formats MUST demonstrate conformity to one or serveral of the following specifications 

* [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html)
* [JWT](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7519)

### Methods of Test



# Digital Trust Services
Digital trust services may consist of the following components that can be assessed for the purposes of conformity:

## Issuing Services

## Verification Services

# Verifiable Data Registry
A role a system might perform by mediating the creation and verification of identifiers, keys, and other relevant data, such as verifiable credential schemas, revocation registries, issuer public keys, and so on, which might be required to use verifiable credentials. Some configurations might require correlatable identifiers for subjects. Example verifiable data registries include trusted databases, decentralized databases, government ID databases, and distributed ledgers. Often there is more than one type of verifiable data registry utilized in an ecosystem. [Source](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/)
