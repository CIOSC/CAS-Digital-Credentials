# Conformity Assessment

## What is conformity assessment?

Conformity assessment is the demonstration that what is being supplied actually meets the requirements specified or claimed. Conformity assessment can be applied to a **product** (which, for these purposes includes a service), a **process**, a **management system**., a **body** or **persons** and can include activities such as **testing**, **inspection** and **certification**.

Conformity can be:
* assessed by a body that is independent of any party interested in the outcome of the assessment (third party conformity assessment); or
* assessed by any party that is interested in the outcome of the assessment.

This document focuses on the application of third-party conformity assessment given that it is an open market activity and the government therefore has a more active interest in it than in first- or second-party conformity assessment. This should not however be taken to indicate a preference for third party conformity assessment and some of the principles set out may equally apply to first- and second-party conformity assessment.

Accreditation is also conformity assessment but as it is used to evaluate third party conformity assessors, it functions better as part of the framework for the conformity assessment market rather than within it. In this paper therefore accreditation is considered separately from other forms of conformity assessment.

A conformity assessment scheme (‘scheme’) is used to demonstrate that specified requirements relating to a product, process, system, person, or body are fulfilled. Schemes can range from being voluntary, self-regulated for commercial marketing purposes, to mandatory schemes owned by certification bodies who are accredited, carried out by authorized independent assessors, and subject to normative and informative documents, such as national standards, related policies, and guidelines.

## Why conformity assessment?

The global scope and borderless nature of digital trust and identity services has facilitated the rapid growth of the digital economy. For established economic sectors, such as manufacturing and distribution, there are hundreds of third-party national and multinational conformity assessment bodies.


## Benefits of conformity assessment

Demonstrating compliance with standards and other criteria assumes greater importance to consumer confidence as products and services etc. become increasingly technically complex. Conformity assessment is thus an indispensable part of a national, business, technology and quality infrastructure. When applied correctly, conformity assessment can:
* provide purchasers with confidence in the suppliers, products or services they use.
* help businesses be competitive;
* facilitate trade;
* create market advantage; and
* provide a visible link between standards and the market.

If applied incorrectly however, conformity assessment can also:
* be a burden on business;
* create barriers to trade;
* inhibit innovation; and
* confuse the market.

**Consumers** benefit from conformity assessment because it provides them with a basis for selecting products or services. They may have more confidence in products or services that are supported by a formal supplier’s declaration, or bearing a mark or certificate of conformity, that attest to quality,safety or other desirable characteristics

**Manufacturers and service providers** need to make sure that their products and services meet their declared specifications and deliver on customer expectations. Assessing their products and services in accordance with ISO and IEC International Standards helps them to meet the current state of the art and to avoid the costs of product failures in the market. When public health, safety or the environment may be at stake, conformity assessment is often made obligatory by government regulations. Without appropriate assessment and approval, goods may be barred from sale, or suppliers disqualified from bidding for government procurement contracts. ISO/IEC International Standards and Guides also provide requirements and guidance for good practice and recog nition of such assessments.

**Regulators** benefit from conformity assessment that gives them a means to enforce national health, safety and environmental legislation and achieve public policy goals.Harmonizing conformity assessment procedures around the world also has far-reaching benefits for international trade in general. One of the main hurdles to cross-border trade that exporters face is costly multiple testing and/or certification of products.
Non-transparent or discriminatory conformity assessment procedures can become effective protectionist tools, or “technical barriers to trade”.

### Conformity Assessment principles

Conformity assessment principles are as follows:
* Conformity assessment schemes should be driven by market demand (including demand from end-users and consumers) or, where justified by the public interest, by regulators rather than by those with a commercial interest in conformity assessment.
*Except where the government has specialist regulatory expertise and responsibilities, or where justified by legitimate end-user/consumer concerns, conformity assessment should be a free-market, competitive activity.
* Where conformity assessment depends on the measurement of the parameters of performance of a product or process, measurements or test results should be traceable to national or international measurement standards.
* Where conformity assessment is required in support of regulation, the infrastructure developed for non-regulatory conformity assessment should be used as far as is possible.
* Conformity assessment should be conducted to recognised standards, preferably national and/or international standards, or other transparent and objective criteria, such as technical regulations, in a non-discriminatory manner.

Conformity assessment schemes and any associated marks should be developed and used so that they facilitate, not discourage, innovation and trade; and/or should be developed and used so that they protect public interest and legitimate end-user concerns (e.g. safety). Conformity assessment schemes should be developed in accordance with national policy and international standards, for conformity assessment schemes.

Conformity assessment procedures that impose the lightest burden on business, commensurate with the objective to be achieved (e.g. regulatory confidence or product/workplace safety) should be preferred over other more onerous procedures.
Conformity assessment bodies (CABs) should demonstrate competence by seeking accreditation against the relevant national (Standard Council of Canada) and international standards, in particular the ISO 2 /IEC 3 normative documents.
Application of conformity assessment principles

In applying these principles:
* supports national measurement infrastructure for conformity assessment and, through mutual recognition agreements, equivalence with measurement standards in other countries;
* recommends the use of the national and international standards infrastructure for the development of standards and other criteria for conformity assessment and participates in the standards development process where appropriate; and
promotes the use of accredited conformity assessment bodies, as a means of improving competitiveness and facilitating trade.
