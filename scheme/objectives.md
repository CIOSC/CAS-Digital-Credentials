# Scheme Objective


The objective of the conformity assessment of products, processes or services is to give confidence to all interested parties that a product, process or service fulfills specified requirements. The value of a conformity assessment scheme is to contribute to the degree of confidence and trust that can established by an impartial and competent demonstration of fulfillment of specified requirements carried out by a third-party.

A conformity assessment scheme:
* provides consumers (users) of products with sufficient information to allow them to make informed decisions on products and services;
* assists the suppliers to achieve market acceptance. If the product has a recognizable mark on it consumers may be more willing to make the purchase;
* can play a role in regulated products (subject to technical regulations);
* assists vendors and customers in selecting the components for their own products and services;
* gives confidence to solution providers and integrators confidence in the products they are using.

A general overview of the [conformity assessment process](./conformity-assessment-process.md)

A description of [conformity assessment approach](conformity-assessment-approach.md) that is specific to this scheme.

To support a protototye conformity assessment program, this conformity assesment scheme (CAS) is being developed in accordance with [IAF MD25](https://iaf.nu/iaf_system/uploads/documents/IAF_MD_25_Criteria_for_the_Evaluation_of_CAS_07012022.pdf) and consists of the following:

* [Scheme Objectives](./objectives.md) for the specific industry or user group.
* [Objects of Conformity Assessment](objects-of-conformity-assessment.md) for the products and/or services
* [Requirements for Conformity Assessment](./objects/objca-template.md) are specified using a standardized template.
* [Conformity Assessment Approach](./conformity-assessment-approach.md) used to determine conformity of the objects, including [IAF MLA Level 3 standards](./iaf-mla-level3.md) without any contradiction or exclusions.
* [17011 Specific Application](./17011-specific-application.md) any specific application or explanation in accordance with ISO 17011 that is relevant to the CAS
*  [17021 Specific Application](./17021-specific-application.md) and specific application or explantation in accordance with ISO 17065

## Conformance

* To provide confidence that a product, process or service component is conforming to the relevant standard or specification and is functioning correctly in relation to that standard or specification. 

## Interoperability

* To enable broad interoperability within and across digital credential ecosystems, enabling seamless services and secure exchange on behalf of the user.
