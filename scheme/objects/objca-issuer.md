### Issue Credential

#### Actors
 - Issuer

#### Description

#### Preconditions

1. _Claims_ that are to be included in a _Credential_ are available for that purpose.
1. A format for _Credentials_ that are to be issued is defined.
1. A process for assigning a _Credential_ to an appropriate _Holder_ is defined.

#### Triggers – this is the event that causes the use case to be initiated.
1. An appropriate _Holder_ has made a request for a _Credential_.
