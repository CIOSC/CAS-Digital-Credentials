# Conformity Assessment Scheme

## Background and Context

A conformity assessment is the demonstration that specified requirements relating to a product, process, system person or body are fulfilled.(ISO/IEC 17000, Clause 2.1). It is an activity which results in determining whether or not products, services, processes, management systems or persons meet the requirements of standards or other specifications.

This scheme is being developed in accordance with the direction [Government of Canada Digital Credentials](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/digital-government-innovations/digital-credentials.html) direction:

"_Canadians expect easy, secure, and trusted access to digital services. They want to control who can and—more importantly—can’t, access their digital information. Digital credentials offer Canadians the ability to confirm their identity during service transactions. Government is looking to leverage new technology to meet this need, while ensuring that trust is maintained and privacy is protected when interacting with government in Canada. As the digital credentials ecosystem evolves, the credentials could be used by other public and private sector services._"

## Objective of a Conformity Assessment Scheme

The objective of the conformity assessment scheme is to give confidence to all interested parties that a product, process or service fulfills specified requirements. The value of a conformity assessment scheme is to contribute to the degree of confidence and trust that can established by an impartial and competent demonstration of fulfillment of specified requirements carried out by a third-party conformity assessment scheme:

* provides consumers (users) of products with sufficient information to allow them to make informed decisions on products and services;
* assists the suppliers to achieve market acceptance. If the product has a recognizable mark on it consumers may be more willing to make the purchase;
* can play a role in regulated products (subject to technical regulations);
* assists vendors and customers in selecting the components for their own products and services;
* gives confidence to solution providers and integrators confidence in the products they are using.

A general overview of the [conformity assessment process](./conformity-assessment-process.md)

A description of [conformity assessment approach](conformity-assessment-approach.md) that is specific to this scheme.

To support a protototye conformity assessment program, this conformity assesment scheme (CAS) is being developed in accordance with [IAF MD25](https://iaf.nu/iaf_system/uploads/documents/IAF_MD_25_Criteria_for_the_Evaluation_of_CAS_07012022.pdf) and consists of the following:

* [Scheme Objectives](./objectives.md) for the specific industry or user group.
* [Objects of Conformity Assessment](objects-of-conformity-assessment.md) for the products and/or services
* [Requirements for Conformity Assessment](./objects/objca-template.md) are specified using a standardized template.
* [Conformity Assessment Approach](./conformity-assessment-approach.md) used to determine conformity of the objects, including [IAF MLA Level 3 standards](./iaf-mla-level3.md) without any contradiction or exclusions.
* [17011 Specific Application](./17011-specific-application.md) any specific application or explanation in accordance with ISO 17011 that is relevant to the CAS
* [17021 Specific Application](./17021-specific-application.md) and specific application or explantation in accordance with ISO 17065

## Conformance

* To provide confidence that a product, process or service component is conforming to the relevant standard or specification and is functioning correctly in relation to that standard or specification.

## Interoperability

* To enable broad interoperability within and across digital credential ecosystems, enabling seamless services and secure exchange on behalf of the user.

## Intended Purpose and Scope

This scheme is intended to support a conformity assessment approach that may be used to support a prototype conformity assessment program for digital credentials and digital trust services. 

This scheme is intended to be a [method of test](./methods-of-tests.md), which provides repeatable and reproducble procedures with consistent outcomes for the assessment of the product.

The scope of this scheme specifies the minimum requirements to enable the development of a conformity assessment program for: **digital credential management systems** that **issue**, **manage**, **store**, **present**,and **verify** machine‐readable digital credentials. This includes: **digital trust services** which is defined as including **verifiable data registries**, **issuing and verifying services**, and **digital wallets**.

**Digital Credentials** are portable digital records about a subject (e.g., organization, individual, product) that can be held and shared through a user-controlled wallet. They are the digital representation of traditional physical certificates or information, such as:

* Personal identification
* Proof of payment (e.g., plane ticket)
* Certificate of incorporation
* University degrees

**Digital Trust Services** are enabling services for digital credentials, such as blockchain-based verifiable data registry, issuing and verifying services and digital wallets.


* The intended application of the conformity assessment scheme is in relation to product certification criteria under [ISO/IEC17065](https://www.iso.org/standard/46568.html).

* This scheme is intended to be used to assess public and private credentials to ensure they meet the minimum requirements for interoperability, safety, privacy and well-being of Canadians.

* This scheme will provide technical requirements for digital credentials and digital trust services, with the expectation that these will form the foundation of related conformity assessment solutions.

* The scheme will take into account consideratons of: 
  * Regulatory and market needs for the safe commercialization of digital credentials and digital trust services,
