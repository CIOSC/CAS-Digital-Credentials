# Conformity Assessment Scheme


# Background and Context
Conformity assessment is the demonstration that specified requirements relating to a product, process, system person or body are fulfilled.(ISO/IEC 17000, Clause 2.1). It is an activity which results in determining whether or not products, services, processes, management systems or persons meet the requirements of standards or other specifications.


This scheme is being developed in accordance with the direction [Government of Canada Digital Credentials](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/digital-government-innovations/digital-credentials.html) direction:

"_Canadians expect easy, secure, and trusted access to digital services. They want to control who can and—more importantly—can’t, access their digital information. Digital credentials offer Canadians the ability to confirm their identity during service transactions. Government is looking to leverage new technology to meet this need, while ensuring that trust is maintained and privacy is protected when interacting with government in Canada. As the digital credentials ecosystem evolves, the credentials could be used by other public and private sector services._"

# Objective of Conformity Assessment Scheme

The objective of the conformity assessment scheme is to give confidence to all interested parties that a product, process or service fulfills specified requirements. The value of a conformity assessment scheme is to contribute to the degree of confidence and trust that can established by an impartial and competent demonstration of fulfillment of specified requirements carried out by a third-party.

# Intended Purpose and Scope

This scheme is intended to support a conformity assessment approach that may be used to support a prototype conformity assessment program for digital credentials and digital trust services. 

This scheme is intended to be a [method of test](./methods-of-tests.md), which provides repeatable and reproducble procedures with consistent outcomes for the assessment of the product.

The scope of this scheme specifies the minimum requirements to enable the development of a conformity assessment program for: **digital credential management systems** that **issue**, **manage**, **store**, **present**,and **verify** machine‐readable digital credentials. This includes: **digital trust services** which is defined as including **verifiable data registries**, **issuing and verifying services**, and **digital wallets**.

**Digital Credentials** are portable digital records about a subject (e.g., organization, individual, product) that can be held and shared through a user-controlled wallet. They are the digital representation of traditional physical certificates or information, such as:
* Personal identification
* Proof of payment (e.g., plance ticket)
* Certificate of incorporation
* University degrees

**Digital Trust Services** are enabling services for digital credentials, such as blockchain-based verifiable data registry, issuing and verifying services and digital wallets.


* The intended application of the conformity assessment scheme is in relation to product certification criteria under [ISO/IEC17065](https://www.iso.org/standard/46568.html).

* This scheme is intended to be used to assess public and private credentidials to ensure they meet the minimum requirements for interoperability, safety, privacy and well-being of Canadians.

* This scheme will provide technical requirements for digital requirements and digital trust services, with the expectation that these will form the foundation of related conformity assessment solutions.

* The scheme will take into account consideratons of: 
    * Regulatory and market needs for the safe commericialization of digital credentials and digital trust services,
