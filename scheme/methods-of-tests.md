# Methods of Test

Adapted from ISO/IEC 17007

Methods of test which provides repeatable and reproducible procedures with consistent outcomes for the assessment of the product.

Test methods can be drawn up by ISO/TCs and SCs, however they must simply outline the process and thresholds of testing, and must not include provisions on who should undertake the test, or establish the conformity assessment structure that might employ such test methods within it.

## Generalized Test Method Requirements

* Test methods SHOULD describe clearly how the test is to be performed including the choice and preparation of the samples, use of testing equipment,the data to be recorded, the acceptance criteria, acceptance and rejection limits and what is acceptable in terms of uncertainty of measurement, accuracy, reproducibility and repeatability.
* Test methods SHOULD be selected bearing in mind their effectiveness, economy and practical application
* Non-destructive tests SHOULD be chosen whenever they provide the same level of confidence as destructive tests
* The document SHOULD specify the sequence of tests when the sequence can influence the results
* If different test methods are permitted from those that are specified, it SHOULD be required to maintain a documented correlation of the test results with the specified test methods
* Test methods SHOULD follow the metrological principles concerning validation, measurement trace ability and estimation of uncertainty
* When specifying test methods, it is good practice to investigate whether the test methods referred to specify requirements related to testing equipment. 
If this is not the case, such requirements SHOULD be considered for inclusion in the normative document. Requirements related to testing equipment SHOULD follow the provisions concerning accuracy and calibration

* Methods of test can be used in combination with a number of related product standards and guides to demonstrate that a product complies with specified criteria.

## Software Test Methods

* **Black Box Testing** tests the functionality of an application based on the requirement specification. It does not focus on the internal structure or code of the application.
* **White Box Testing** examines the program structure and business logic. Testers perform validation of the entire code structure of an application. It is also called clear box testing, glass box testing, open box testing, transparent box testing, and structural testing.
* **Manual Testing** uses manual methods with human testers.
* **Automated Testing** uses scripts and tools

## Conformance

The conformity assessment scheme shall indicate whether it is testing for claims against full or tailored conformance.

* **Full Conformance** Full conformance is achieved by demonstrating that all of the requirements (i.e., SHALL statements) of the chosen (non-empty) set of techniques and correspoding test coverange measurement approaches have been satisfied.
* **Tailored Conformance** Tailored conformance is achieved by demonstrating that the chosen subset of requirements from the chosen (non-empty) set of techniques and corresponding test coverage measurement approaches have been satisfied. Where tailoring occurs, justification shall be provided (either directly or by reference)

## Test Design Techniques

The conformity assessment scheme shall indicate the types of testig employed along with rationale.

* **Specification-based testing** where the tesat basis (e.g., requirements, specifications, or user needs) is used as the main source of information to design test cases.
* **Structure-based testing** where the structure of the test item (e.g. source code or the structure of the model) is used as the primary source of information to design testing.
* **Experience-base testing** where the knowledge and experience of the tester is used as the primary source of information during test case design.

## Testing Quality Characteristics

Testing shall be carried out to collect evidence on how well required quality criteria have been satisfied by a test item. Testing quality characteristics may include, but not be limited to the following:

* **Functional suitability** Functional completeness. Functional correctness. Functional appropriatness.
* **Performance efficiency** Time behaviour. Resource utilization. Capacity.
* **Compatibility** Co-existence. Interoperability.
* **Usability** Appropriateness. Recognizability. Learnability. Operability. User error protection. User interface aesthetics. A
* **Reliability** Maturity. Avaialability. Fault Tolerance. Recoverability.
* **Security** Confidentitality. Integrity. Non-repudiation. Accountability. Authenticity.
* **Maintainability** Modularity. Reusability. Analysability. Modifiability. Testability.
* **Portability** Adaptability. Installability. Replaceability.
* **Accessiblity** Determination whether test item can be operated by users with the widest range of characterists and capabilities, including specific accessibility requirements.
