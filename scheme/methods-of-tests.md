# Methods of Test
Methods of test which provides repeatable and reproducible procedures with consistent outcomes for the assessment of the product.

	
Test methods can be drawn up by ISO/TCs and SCs, however they must simply outline the process and thresholds of testing, and must not include provisions on who should undertake the test, or establish the conformity assessment structure that might employ such test methods within it.

# Test Method Requirements

Adapted from ISO`IEC 17007

* Test methods SHOULD describe clearly how the test is to be performed includ ing the choice and preparation of the samples, use of testing equipment,the data to be recorded, the acceptance criteria, acceptance and rejection limits and what is acceptable in terms of uncertainty of measurement, accuracy, reproducibility and repeatability.
* Test methods SHOULD be selected bearing in mind their effectiveness, economy and practical application
* Non-destructive tests SHOULD be chosen whenever they provide the same level of confidence as destructive tests
* The document SHOULD specify the sequence of tests when the sequence can influence the results
* If different test methods are permitted from those that are specified, it SHOULD be required to maintain a documented correlation of the test results with the specified test methods
* Test methods SHOULD follow the metrological principles concerning validation, measurement trace ability and estimation of uncertainty
* When specifying test methods, it is good practice to investigate whether the test methods referred to specify requirements related to testing equipment. If this is not the case, such requirements
SHOULD be considered for inclusion in the normative document. Requirements related to testing equipment SHOULD follow the provisions concerning accuracy and calibration





## Method of Test
For each object of conformity of assessment, the following MUST be carried out:

1. Description of component (or components) that
