# Draft Versions

The CIO Strategy Council, in partnership with the Standards Council of Canada (SCC) and the Government of Canada, is happy to launch this public review. Once published, this technical specification will set minimum certification requirements to ensure that digital credentials and trust services are interoperable between businesses and governments and create a seamless experience for users. This work will inform a National Standard of Canada that will be developed under SCC’s accreditation.

The draft, **CIOSC TS 115 National Technical Specification for Digital Credentials and Digital Trust Services**, will be available on the CIO Strategy Council website for public review and stakeholder feedback. The deadline for comments will be set shortly.

In the meantime, the versions are unoffically available below:
